Review Documentation:

Check the latest teslapy documentation for any changes in authentication methods.
Confirm the correct way to provide credentials.
Placeholders for credentials: Replace YOUR_EMAIL, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_VEHICLE_VIN with your actual Tesla account credentials and vehicle VIN.
Upgrade or Downgrade Packages:

Try upgrading teslapy and related libraries to their latest versions using pip.
If the issue persists, consider downgrading to a previous version where the access_token argument was accepted.
Alternative Authentication:

Explore alternative authentication methods if supported by teslapy, such as OAuth2 authorization flows.
Troubleshooting Steps:

Update teslapy:

Bash
pip install --upgrade teslapy
Use code with caution. Learn more
Review Documentation:

Consult the latest teslapy documentation for correct authentication methods.
Try Alternative Authentication:

If applicable, experiment with OAuth2 flows or other supported methods.
Provide Error Context:

If the issue persists, share the complete traceback, library versions, and any relevant code snippets for further analysis.

1. Credentials and VIN:

You'll need to replace the placeholders YOUR_EMAIL, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_VEHICLE_VIN with your actual Tesla account credentials and vehicle VIN for the code to work.
2. Error Handling:

The code includes basic error handling for the TeslaVehicleNotFoundError and TeslaAPIError, but you might want to consider more comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential issues like network errors or authentication failures.
3. Further Enhancements:

You could potentially add more features to the app, such as:
Displaying vehicle information (e.g., battery level, charge status, location)
Controlling other vehicle functions (e.g., locking/unlocking doors, honking the horn, adjusting climate)
Implementing a more visually appealing UI using Kivy's widgets and layouts
4. Dependencies:

Remember to install the required libraries teslapy and kivy using pip
